Are loyalty programs a valid strategy for airline companies to overcome post-pandemic hardships?

## Selected Topic
Covid-19 has turned the whole world upside down. Many of the strongest, toughest industries have had to rethink their business models and strategies. Governments and companies alike, have come to realize that they cannot keep working the same way as before the pandemic. Time has come to make necessary adjustments to survive and to rebuild what has been affected. 

Travel restrictions and the implications of traveling during Covid-19 times have specially altered the way people use airplanes. Airlines had huge impacts during the pandemic, as well as hotels in touristic destinations. To get a better sense of the magnitude of the pandemic, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) released a publication showing exactly how devastating it was for the overall air transport services. According to IATA, 1.8 billion passengers flew in 2020, a decrease of 60.2% compared to the 4.5 billion who flew in 2019. This represented very important revenue losses; the total industry passenger revenues fell by 69% to $189 billion in 2020, and net losses were $126.4 billion in total. On average, there was a $71.7 loss incurred per passenger in 2020. (Source: https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2021-08-03-01/)

Companies have been actively looking for ways to spend their resources effectively and efficiently. With no dollar to spare, they are looking into many alternatives that have the most impact in recovering their operations. Throughout the hospitality and travel industry, many of the companies have turned their sights on loyalty programs to help them accomplish this goal. Many reports and publications on loyalty programs show just how impactful a well-deviced loyalty program can be. According to Invesp (https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-loyalty-programs/) 74% of travel customers surveyed have made purchasing decisions based on travel reward programs. When looking at Linchpinseo's publication (https://linchpinseo.com/trends-customer-loyalty-programs/) we see that currently, 80% of a companyâ€™s future revenue will come from just 20% of existing clients and that it costs 5% more to acquire a new customer than keep an existing one satisfied and happy. In conclusion, it its harder, and less fruitful, to gain new customers than it is to maintain the ones the company already has. 

The data analytics department is working alongside Mexicana Aviacion to implement a machine learning model that helps them predict whether people purchesing tickets will become loyal customers or not. The purpose, of course, is to aid in resource allocation in order to invest wisely and to tap into the potential that loyalty programs present to travel companies. Thanks to this model, Mexicana Aviacion will understand their clientele better and will have better decision-making insights to help them take care of their loyal customers first and foremost. 

## Importance of selected topic
The tourism industry consists of hospitality, transportation, travel facilitation and information and attractions and entertainment. According to the World Travel & Tourism Counci (WTTC), as a whole, the travel & tourism sector suffered a loss of almost US$4.5 trillion dollars in 2020, with the contribution to GDP dropping by a staggering 49.1% compared to 2019. In 2019, it contributed 10.4% to global GDP; a share which decreased to 5.5% in 2020 due to ongoing restrictions to mobility. The impact of this massive decline in number of travelers goes a long way. In 2020, 62 million jobs were lost, representing a drop of 18.5%, leaving just 272 million employed across the sector globally, compared to 334 million in 2019 (WTTC).

Not only does the economy need an urgent uplift, but so does the job markets all over the world. Economic re-activation has to begin in every single industry. However, the importance of the travel and tourism sector cannot be underrated.

## Data sourcing
 For the purpose of this investigation, data was obtained from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction?select=test.csv). Kaggle is a crowd-sourced platform created to attract, nurture, train and challenge data scientists from all around the world to solve data science, machine learning and predictive analytics problems. It has over 536,000 active members from 194 countries and it receives close to 150,000 submissions per month. This particular dataset contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey with columns such as Age, Gender, Type of Travel, Flight Distance, among many others.


## Questions to address
As stated previously, companies are actively trying to regain what was lost during the pandemic. Customers and jobs. In order to accomplish this goal, they are looking into several strategies and alternatives that help them gain new customers and maintain the ones already on board. This investigation aims to address the following question: "Are loyalty programs a valid strategy for airline companies to overcome post-pandemic hardships?". 

In order to obtain some knowledge about the main issue at hand, a few other questions were born. First of all, can a machine learning model predict the type of customer (loyal vs disloyal) a ticket purchaser will become in the future? What factors are highly correlated to the decision to become a loyal customer? Secondly, which are the areas of opportunity?; especifically, where during the "buying of a ticket to completing the flight" process does the company lose or gain the client's loyalty? 


## Communication protocols
Roles are assigned to every member of the investigation team. Based on these, coworkers know their particular set of activities and responsiblities and boundaries were set between each position in order to maintain a cohesive and ordered workspace. In order to accomplish an effective workflow, there is a team member assigned to manage any requests or complaints from the rest of the team. If there are any issues to be handled, there will be a 15-min session on Saturdays to work it out. 

During weekdays, the team meeting is designated on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:00pm to 10:00pm. During this time, team members can work on their individual activities or brain-storm about general issues met during the investigation. An additional meeting was set on Saturdays in order to review the week's advances and plan for the week ahead. 

The official tool for communicating is Slack. Any and all investigation related topics shall be discussed using the official channels in order to keep track of the team's progress. 


## Data exploration phase of the project 
The investigation began by a general analysis of the tourism and travel industry and how it changed during the course of the pandemic, with the purpose of understading the current situation better. Once that was done, the data analytics team looked for databases that could be used to implement our proposed model and build up the prediction strategy. 

Many databases were compared, looking for data that represented the current industry's situation more precisely. However, we are currently developing our machine-learning model based on the database previously mentioned. 

## Description of the analysis phase of the project
At this point in the investigation, the team is tirelessly working towards achieving the best possible machine-learning model. Many tweaks are being analyzed in order to make our predictions stronger. 


### Database
The database contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey, the factors that lead the customer satisfaction for an Airline. The database contains 103,904 data points for training and 25,976 data points for test with the following columns:

## Machine Learning Model
Machine learning is the use of statistical algorithms to perform tasks such as learning from data patterns and making predictions.

Supervised learning is an approach to creating artificial intelligence, where a our algorithm is trained on input data of Airline Passenger Satisfaction,that has been labeled. The model will be trained until it can detect a relationships between the input data and the output labels.

In this project we are determining the satisfaction for a future customer.

#### Dataset Information
This dataset contains the outcomes of **103,904** airline passenger satisfaction survey. The variables of this dataset are highly correlated to predict if the passenger could become a loyal customer. According to the importance of customer loyalty programs - statistics and trends, **80%** of a companyâ€™s future revenue will come from just 20% of existing clients. This way, the airline could launch a loyalty program strategy to overcome the post-pandemic hardships. 

The dataset includes the following columns:

* `gender`: Gender of the passengers (Female/Male).
* `customer type`: The customer type (Loyal customer/Disloyal customer).
* `age`: The actual age of the passengers.
* `type travel`: Purpose of the flight of the passengers (Personal Travel/Business Travel).
* `class`: Travel class in the plane of the passengers (Business/Eco/Eco Plus).
* `flight distance`: The flight distance of this journey.
* `departure delay`: Minutes delayed when departure.
* `arrival delay`: Minutes delayed when arrival.
* `satisfaction`: Airline satisfaction level (satisfied/neutral or dissatisfied).

To start the data preprocessing, the dataset was then sent to Postgresql using Amazon Web Services.

#### Data preprocessing 
The dataset contains categorical and text features (gender, customer type, type travel, class and satisfaction). Therefore, these features 
must be converted to numerical data for use in our machine learning model. In order to clean and prepare the data for the model, several steps were established. They go as follows:

1. Detect missing values with the Pandas DataFrame function *isna()*.
2. Make sure we are using the correct variables data types -Pandas DataFrame *dtypes* property.
3. Use Scikit-learns *LabelEncoder* module to transform categorical and text variables into numerical data as follows:
    
* `gender`: 0 (Female), 1 (Male)
* `customer_type`: 0 (Loyal Customer), 1 (Disloyal Customer)
* `type_travel`: 0 (Business travel), 1 (Personal Travel) 
* `class`: 0 (Business), 1 (Eco), 2 (Eco Plus)
* `satisfaction`: 0 (neutral or dissatisfied), 1 (satisfied)

4. Drop the identification `id` column.
5. Finally, verify the information about the DataFrame, including the index type and columns, non-null values, and memory usage.

#### Feature engineering and feature selection
Based on available data, the decision was made to keep every column except for any column that worked as an identifier. This was decided because the rest of the columns referred to customer satisfaction and flight characteristics. Bottom line, all the rest of available columns have an impact on loyalty, and therefore, were considered to be important for the analysis.  

#### Splitting data into training and testing sets
The defined target was Customer type, where only two options are available: loyal or disloyal. On the other hand, our features can be found on the Database section of this document.  

We split the dataset into **random** train and test subsets using the Scikit-learn **train_test_split** module. The training subset will be used in the model to learn from it and the testing subset to assess its performance. We configure the **train_test_split** module with four arguments:

* The `input X` variables
* The `output y` or what we wish to predict: **Customer type** 
* `random_state` of 1 to ensure that the equals rows are assigned to train and test sets, respectively.
* `stratify` enabled to divide the number of loyal and disloyal customers proportionally 

#### Model choice
The model chosen was logistic regression. A logistic regression model is a classification algorithm that can analyze continuous and categorical variables. With the combination of input variables, logistic regression predicts the probability of the input data belonging to one of two groups. On the other hand, we consider a logistic regression model due to the number of data points in our dataset being fewer than two hundred thousand (103,904) with eight independent variables and one target. Also, our dataset contains numerical and categorical variables.

For this investigation, the objective was to predict whether new purchasing clients will be loyal or disloyal. The purpose of predicting this outcome is to create better loyalty programs and to dedicate resources to the right customers. 

After creating the model, it was confirmed that this particular data could be correctly analyzed using this strategy.

#### Fit (train) the model using the training data
Due to the variables values of flight distance and flight delay (departure and arrival) in miles and minutes, respectively, the data train subset was scaled using the Scikit-learn **StandardScaler** module. After adjusting the training dataset, we trained the logistic regression model using the **fit()** method with **77,928 data points**.

<img src="images/mlm_05.PNG" width="450" >

#### Final Accuracy score
The model achieved an accuracy score of **0.89** which means that nine of ten observations in the testing set were predicted correctly. Thus, this extremely high metric should raise our suspicion of **overfitting**. However, testing the model with another dataset that contains the outcomes of **25,976** airline passenger satisfaction surveys turns out a similar accuracy score of **0.9**

<img src="images/mlm_06.PNG" width="450" >

#### Confusion Matrix
**Precision**

From our results, the precision for the loyal customers can be determined by the ratio TP/ (TP + FP), which is 20,082/ (20,082 + 1,758) = 0.9195. The precision for the disloyal customers can be determined as follows: 2,987/ (2,987 + 1,149) = 0.7221. Thus, this high precision is indicative of a low number of false positives predictions.

**Recall**

From our results, the recall for the loyal customers can be determined by the ratio TP/ (TP + FN), which is 20,082/ (20,082 + 1,149) = 0.9458. The recall for the disloyal customers can be determined as follows: 2,987/ (2,987 + 1,758) = 0.6295. Thus, this high recall is indicative of a low number of false negative predictions.

**F1 score**

From our results, the harmonic mean can be determined by the formula 2(Precision * Sensitivity)/ (Precision + Sensitivity), which is 0.93 and 0.67 for the loyal and disloyal customers, respectively. Therefore, the high sensitivity means that among loyal customers, most of them will be diagnosed correctly. High precision, on the other hand, means that if the test comes back positive, there's a high likelihood that the customer is loyal.
