# Machine Learning Mode
## Final Project Team 7 - Supervised Learning Model

Machine learning is the use of statistical algorithms to perform tasks such as learning from data patterns and making predictions.

Supervised learning is an approach to creating artificial intelligence, where a our algorithm is trained on input data of Airline Passenger Satisfaction,that has been labeled. The model will be trained until it can detect a relationships between the input data and the output labels.

In this project we are determining the satisfaction for a future customer.
